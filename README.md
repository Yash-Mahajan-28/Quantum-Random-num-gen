# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

## üéØ Introduction

This project implements a **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)** using quantum circuits and the principles of quantum superposition. Unlike classical pseudo-random number generators that use deterministic algorithms, this QRNG leverages the inherent randomness of quantum measurements to produce truly random numbers.

The application features an interactive web interface built with Streamlit, allowing users to generate random numbers, visualize their distribution, and perform statistical analysis to verify uniformity.

## üìö Background

### Quantum Random Number Generation

Traditional random number generators (RNGs) are **pseudo-random** - they use deterministic algorithms that produce sequences that appear random but are actually predictable given the initial seed. In contrast, **quantum random number generators** exploit fundamental quantum mechanical properties to generate truly random numbers.

### The Science Behind It

1. **Quantum Superposition:** When a qubit is put through a Hadamard gate (H), it enters a superposition state:
   ```
   H|0‚ü© = (|0‚ü© + |1‚ü©) / ‚àö2
   ```
   The qubit exists in both states simultaneously with equal probability.

2. **Measurement Collapse:** Upon measurement, the superposition collapses to either |0‚ü© or |1‚ü© with exactly 50% probability each. This is fundamentally random according to quantum mechanics.

3. **Multiple Qubits:** Using n qubits, we can generate numbers in the range [0, 2^n - 1]. Each measurement produces a random bit string that represents a decimal number.

### Applications

- **Cryptography:** Secure key generation for encryption
- **Monte Carlo Simulations:** More reliable statistical simulations
- **Gaming and Lotteries:** Fair and unpredictable outcomes
- **Scientific Research:** Unbiased sampling in experiments

## üî¨ Methodology

### Circuit Design

The quantum circuit consists of:

1. **n Qubits:** User-configurable (2-8 qubits)
2. **Hadamard Gates:** Applied to all qubits to create superposition
3. **Measurement:** All qubits measured in computational basis
